Where (R.Course = 'BIOL') and (S.StudNum = R.StudNum)
Order by S.SurName


4.	Count the number of students taking Biology: 

Select  count(R.StudNum)
From Register as R
Where (R.Course = 'BIOL')


5.	List the assignments (and exams) for Biology: 

Select  A.AssignNum, C.Description
From Assignment as A, Course as C
Where (A.Course = 'BIOL') and (A.Course = C.Course)


6.	List the student number, course code, assignment number, assignment description, assignment weight, and mark for all the philosophy marks for the student with ID 86088:

group by M.StudNum


9.	Compute the final course grade in philosophy, for students who also took Biology:

select M.StudNum, SUM(M.Mark * A.Weighting)/100
from Mark as M, Assignment as A, Register as R
where M.Course = 'PHIL' and R.Course = 'BIOL' and M.AssignNum = A.AssignNum and M.Course = A.Course and M.StudNum = R.StudNum
group by M.StudNum
